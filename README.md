A simple background task windows phone 8.1 application that triggers based on network changes. For some reason, the internet availabe system trigger wasn't working for me based as expected. It worked pretty well for the Windows 8.1 but not on the windows phone 8.1 application. What this app essentially does is shows a toast notification when the phone gets connected to a wifi and dispalys the WIFI's SSID
